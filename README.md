# fsg23-approximate-dv-track
Based on Starkstrom's telemetry video of their 2023 Trackdrive run at FSG, the approximate cone position are extracted in a Jupyter notebook

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MWKDJeAEDU) is the video this repository is based on.

If you are impatient, you can just look at the [final result](track.json).
